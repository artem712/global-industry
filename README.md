This project’s main idea is to develop a system software for industries
through which they can manage operations based on the orders they get for
manufacturing their products. In every industry there is always waste of
time and human resources because of irregular management system. Using
this application, it would be easy for organizing it.

The Administrator or the Company technician will manage application
where he/she will daily update products list and employee list. He/ She will
update information of every available product in to database along with the
quantity of each product and as soon as the products are sold system will
automatically update the database.
